# Unbounded Knapsack (Repetition of items allowed)
Given a knapsack weight W and a set of n items with certain value vali and weight wti, we need to calculate minimum amount that could make up this quantity exactly. This is different from classical Knapsack problem, here we are allowed to use unlimited number of instances of an item.

Examples:

Input : W = 100
       val[]  = {1, 30}
       wt[] = {1, 50}
Output : 100
There are many ways to fill knapsack.
1) 2 instances of 50 unit weight item.
2) 100 instances of 1 unit weight item.
3) 1 instance of 50 unit weight item and 50
   instances of 1 unit weight items.
We get maximum value with option 2.

Input : W = 8
       val[] = {10, 40, 50, 70}
       wt[]  = {1, 3, 4, 5}       
Output : 110 
We get maximum value with one unit of
weight 5 and one unit of weight 3.



# Notes
- n, w are 8 bits each.
- val, wt are roms 16x8bits.

## Install

These examples use [ModelSim&reg; and Quartus&reg; Prime from Intel FPGA](http://fpgasoftware.intel.com/?edition=lite), [GIT](https://git-scm.com/download/win), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), make sure they are installed locally on your computer before proceeding.

## Usage

1. Grab a copy of this repository to your computer's local folder (i.e. C:\projects):

    ```sh
    $ cd projects
    $ git clone https://github.com/Salem22/UnboundedKnapsack.git
    ```
2. Use Visual Studio Code (VSC) to edit and view the design files:

    ```sh
    $ cd UnboundedKnapsack
    $ code .
    ```
    Click on the toplevel.vhd file in the left pane to view its contents.
    
3. From the VSC View menu, choose Terminal, in the VCS Terminal, create a "work" library:

    ```sh
    $ vlib work
    ```
    
4. Compile all the design units:

    ```sh
    $ vcom *.vhd
    ```
    
5. Simulate your design. For example, if w = 100, n = 3, val = {10, 30, 50}, wt = {5, 10, 15}  then y = 300:
Note : val, wt elements are specified in val_rom.vhd, wt_rom.vhd respectively.

    ```sh
    $ vsim work.tb
    ```
